# Frontend Mentor - Art gallery website solution

This is a solution to the [Art gallery website challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/art-gallery-website-yVdrZlxyA). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- **Bonus**: Use [Leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com/) to create an interactive location map with custom location pin

- Live Site URL: [Live Demo](https://sqle157.github.io/art-gallery/)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### Continued development

I still need to learn to write cleaner code and understand more about background properties. I also need to learn more about the use of CSS transitions and animations.

I need to learn SCSS to handle multiple stylesheets without repeating unecessary styling/definition. I also need to learn more about the use of CSS variables.
